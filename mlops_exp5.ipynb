Develop the ability to deploy machine learning models using Flask for real-time applications.\n","\n","\n","## Theory\n","\n","- Spam Detection: Spam detection is a binary text classification task where the goal is to classify messages into two categories: ham (non-spam) and spam. It involves preprocessing the text data, transforming it into numerical features, and applying a machine learning algorithm to make predictions.\n","\n","- CountVectorizer: `CountVectorizer` is a feature extraction tool used to convert text data into a bag-of-words representation. It counts the occurrences of words in each message and represents them as sparse matrices for use in machine learning models.\n","\n","- Naive Bayes Classifier: The Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes independence among features and is particularly effective for text classification tasks due to its simplicity and speed.\n","\n","- Flask API: Flask is a lightweight web framework used to build web applications and APIs. In this code, Flask is used to create an API endpoint for real-time spam detection. The trained model and vectorizer are loaded, and predictions are made for input messages.\n","\n","\n","## Procedure\n","\n","- Load the Dataset\n","    - Read the CSV dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`.\n","    - Select relevant columns and rename them for clarity (`label` for spam/ham and `message` for text content).\n","    - Map labels to binary values: `ham` to 0 and `spam` to 1.\n","\n","- Preprocess the Dataset\n","    - Inspect the dataset using `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()` for basic exploration.\n","    - Ensure no missing values are present.\n","    - Split the dataset into training and testing subsets using `train_test_split()`.\n","\n","- Convert Text Data to Numerical Features\n","    - Initialize `CountVectorizer` to tokenize and vectorize the text messages.\n","    - Fit the vectorizer to the training data and transform both training and testing data.\n","\n","- Train the Naive Bayes Classifier\n","    - Initialize the `MultinomialNB` classifier.\n","    - Train the classifier on the vectorized training data using the `fit()` method.\n","\n","- Evaluate the Model\n","    - Use the trained model to predict labels for the test data.\n","    - Compute the accuracy score using `accuracy_score()`.\n","    - Generate a classification report and confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.\n","\n","- Save the Model and Vectorizer: Save the trained model and vectorizer to files using `pickle.dump()` for future use.\n","\n","- Deploy the Model Using Flask\n","    - Load the saved model and vectorizer using `pickle.load()`.\n","    - Initialize a Flask application and define an endpoint for predictions.\n","    - Create a function that accepts a message, preprocesses it using the vectorizer, and predicts whether it's spam or ham using the trained model.\n","    - Return the prediction as a JSON response.\n","\n","\n","## Results\n","\n","- Exploratory Data Analysis\n","    - The dataset contains two categories of messages: spam and ham.\n","    - The dataset is balanced, with ham messages being more prevalent.\n","\n","- Model Performance\n","    - Accuracy: The Naive Bayes classifier achieved an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test dataset.\n","    - Classification Report:\n","      - High precision and recall values for both spam and ham categories.\n","      - F1-scores indicate a well-balanced performance across categories.\n","    - Confusion Matrix: Minimal misclassifications were observed, with most predictions being accurate.\n","\n","- Deployment\n","    - The trained model and vectorizer were successfully saved to files using Pickle.\n","    - The Flask API endpoint `/predict` was implemented to accept POST requests with messages and return predictions as JSON responses.\n","    - Test messages were processed and classified correctly in real-time using the API.\n","\n","\n","## Conclusions\n","The spam detection system using a Naive Bayes classifier demonstrated excellent performance in classifying messages as spam or ham. The preprocessing steps, including label encoding and vectorization, were crucial for achieving high accuracy. Deploying the model using Flask allowed real-time predictions, showcasing the practical applicability of machine learning in text classification.\n","\n","This project highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation in building effective classification systems.
